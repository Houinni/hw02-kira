PART 1
Based on the summary of this model should you keep all of the predictors in the model? If not, which should you drop and why? 

Next, take a look at the correlation between your variables. Do you see any issues? Which variables are most highly correlated? Investigate and describe the relationship between the two sets of highest correlated variables. 

Fit another linear regression model that includes all variables except for one in each pair of most highly correlated variables. How well does this model fit the data? How does this compare to your earlier models? 



PART 2
What do your models tell you about Phil's predictions across various regions? Do you think Phil is good at his job of predicting spring?
